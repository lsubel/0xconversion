# 0xConversion
A number conversion game inspired by [You Can't Do Binary Under Pressure](http://games.usvsth3m.com/binary/) from Us Vs Th3m. The technical architecture and structure is heavily inspired by [2048](https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048) from Gabriele Cirulli.

This game is a byproduct to gain a understanding how to design an interactive web application.
