# 0xConversion
A number conversion game inspired by [You Can't Do Binary Under Pressure](http://games.usvsth3m.com/binary/) from Us Vs Th3m. The technical architecture and structure is heavily inspired by [2048](https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048) from Gabriele Cirulli.

You can play the game [here](https://sheak90.github.io/0xconversion/).

This game is a byproduct of gaining technical understanding how to design an interactive web application.
